The TREDO ministry has three main objectives which are:<br><br>

- to provide education to young children that is well defined as the
harmonious development of all faculties-the physical, the mental, and
the spiritual powers. And since God is the source of all true
knowledge, it is the first object of education to direct children's
minds to His own revelation of Himself; while the Holy Scriptures
stands as the perfect standard of truth, and as such should be given
the highest place in education. Our first objective is to build a good 
educational foundation for children before joining
primary school. Education that does not omit redemption,
education that is Christ-centred, education for this life and life to
come; education that prepares a child for the joy of service and
highest standards.<br><br>
  -to provide nutritious meals for children.<br><br>
  -to establish sustainable income generating activities like poultry
or goat keeping to produce cross-subsidy for the project.
