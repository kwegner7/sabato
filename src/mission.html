  <p class=TitleRow2Col2>MISSION</p>
  <p class=TextRow2Col2>

    The mission of <i>TREDO</i> is to address both spiritual and social
    issues and to alleviate poverty in rural areas of Tanzania through the
    establishment of sustainable development programs and enhancing
    education for the most underprivileged children.
    <br><br>
    In the real sense, <i>TREDO's</i> mission understands that the world is
    in greatest need! The greatest want of the world is the want of men
    and women- men and women who in their early life, had been taught the
    love and fear of God, men and women who will not be bought or sold,
    men and women who in their inmost souls are true and honest, men and
    women who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men and women who
    will stand for the right and truth though the heaven falls. It is for
    these purposes that TREDO was initiated- to impress the truth to
    the youths that their endowments are not their own. Their strengths,
    time, intellect, are but lent treasures. They belong to God, and it
    should be the resolve of every youth to put them to the highest use.
