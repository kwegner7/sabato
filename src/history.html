  <p class=TextRow2Col2>

      The TREDO ministry was founded in 2013 by a NGO known as
      TANZANIA RURAL EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION(TREDO). TREDO
      received a recognition and registered by the government under
      Non-Governmental Organisation Act 2002 with registration no.
      00NGO/00002425 in 2008. The TREDO ministry is an ongoing project that
      has twenty children out of which four are HIV positive. Two trained
      teachers provide Nursery education. 2 cooks provide nutritious meals
      and 1 site worker that makes the total of 25 people in general.
       All activities of the project are funded through small contribution
      from the members of Org. Including monthly contribution and few
      generous donation from the church. Till this moment, we welcome
      whoever is touched with the predicament of these children and wants to
      be counted in as associate member. We also face challenges of reliable
      and committed sponsors. Food for children, learning/teaching aids,
      classrooms, desks/chairs, playing kits. Again, we are still not sure
      how the children who will join class one in the government school get
      their basic needs! We can see their predicaments, tears and sighs that
      no longer count much to many! We can see in sight an excruciating days
      at school and at home if non will avail to take part to support.
