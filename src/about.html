    The word shade, implies a place of quite rest where
    people who are weary and tedious come for safety. The ministry of the
    TREDO Daycare and Nursery school seeks to alleviate the burden of the
    hopeless, vulnerable and orphaned children especially living with
    HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Not all realities are exciting, some are fearful
    but the sad reality is in the fact that in Tanzania those with
    HIV/AIDS can be the victim of massive stigma. In situation where
    resources are severely stretched and families are living on a poverty
    line, some consider it a waste to feed or educate those who (without
    ART) are likely to die anyway. And in the worst cases children suffer
    cruel abuse and neglect. It the most underprivileged, vulnerable,
    hopeless and orphaned children that TREDO seeks to give quite
    rest.
