It you dear friend to see how you can arrange them systematically. You
can also give out your advice whenever you see there is a need to.
Here are the details of the outlined points.

1. ABOUT THE "SHADE." The word shade, implies a place of quite rest where
people who are weary and tedious come for safety. The ministry of the
SHADE Day-care and Nursery school seeks to alleviate the burden of the
hopeless, vulnerable and orphaned children especially living with
HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Not all realities are exciting, some are fearful
but the sad reality is in the fact that in Tanzania those with
HIV/AIDS can be the victim of massive stigma. In situation where
resources are severely stretched and families are living on a poverty
line, some consider it a waste to feed or educate those who(without
ART) are likely to die anyway. And in the worst cases children suffer
cruel abuse and neglect. It the most underprivileged, vulnerable,
hopeless and orphaned children that the SHADE seeks to give quite
rest.


2. LOCATION: The SHADE Day-care and Nursery school is situated in
Busega-Magu district, within Mwanza region near the beautiful shore of
lake Victoria. The specific village where the project is situated is
Sogesca in Mwamanyili ward.


3. AIM: The SHADE ministry aims to reduce the degree of malnutrition for
children under 6yrs especially those living with HIV/AIDS and to build
a good education foundation for children before joining primary
school.


4. OBJECTIVES: the SHADE ministry has three main objectives which are:
  -to build a good education foundation for children before joining
primary school. Education that that does not omit redemption,
education that is Christ-centred, education for this life and life to
come; education that prepares a child for the joy of service and
highest standards.
  -to provide nutritious meals for children.
  -to establish sustainable income generating activities like poultry
or goat keeping to produce cross-subsidy for the project.


5. VISION: the SHADE has a vision to establish a just Nation where love,
justice, equality and equity prevails at all level.


6. MISSION: the SHADE'S mission is to address both spiritual and social
issues and to alleviate poverty in rural areas of Tanzania through the
establishment of sustainable development programs and enhancing
education for the most underprivileged children.


7. HISTORY: The SHADE ministry was founded in 2013 by a NGO known
TANZANIA RURAL EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION(TREDO). TREDO
received a recognition and registered by the government under
Non-Governmental Organisation Act 2002 with registration no.
00NGO/00002425 in 2008. The SHADE ministry is an ongoing project that
has twenty children out of which four are HIV positive. Two trained
teachers provide Nursery education. 2 cooks provide nutritious meals
and 1 site worker that makes the total of 25 people in general.
 All activities of the project are funded through small contribution
from the members of Org. Including monthly contribution and few
generous donation from the church. Till this moment, we welcome
whoever is touched with the predicament of these children and wants to
be counted in as associate member. We also face challenges of reliable
and committed sponsors. Food for children, learning/teaching aids,
classrooms, desks/chairs, playing kits. Again, we are still not sure
how the children who will join class one in the government school get
their basic needs! We can see their predicaments, tears and sighs that
no longer count much to many! We can see in sight an excruciating days
at school and at home if non will avail to take part to support.
