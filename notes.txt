 
Dear friends, Hi.
First, I would like you to make some changes on our website of TREDO. 
Would you please remove the second and the sixth pictures which starts with "when many children enjoy..." and  " 
even if no one avails..." And replace with the pics I have attached. Please don't interfere with the inscriptions.  
Second, I would like you to include my phone numbers in that part of contact. 
Here are they: +255 765 551 410 and +255 686 951 190.
